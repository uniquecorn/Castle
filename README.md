# Castle

A framework for making 2D games in Unity.

**IMPORTANT**
This library is not for beginners and is provided as-is. I update this semi regularly, with new features and tools. You probably don't want to have this auto update in your project. Some of the features are extremely WIP, specifically the Graph systems and Rendering.

**Requirements**
- Odin Inspector and Serializer
- ZString
- UniTask

**NOTE:** You should probably install those first before installing this.

**Installation**
- *(via Package Manager)* click the + button and install the package from the following git URL:
  - `https://github.com/uniquecorn/Castle.git?path=Packages/com.uniquecorn.castle`
- Or just clone and copy the stuff into your project like a neanderthal.

**License**
